# Communicating Evidence Effectively

## Why is communicating evidence important?

### Inform and influence decision making
Understanding and using evidence effectively is crucial to inform good decision making. Analytical Services produce a wide range of analysis and evidence to inform and influence decision making across the Ministry of Justice.

### Analysis needs to be understood for it to be used
The value of evidence and analysis comes from how it is used to influence and improve decision making. Even the best analysis is worthless if the person making the decision doesn’t understand what the analysis means or how to use it.

### Crucial to think how we present information
Therefore, when we produce analysis to inform policy, business or operational decisions, it is essential that we think about how we present the information to help the decision-maker to understand how it affects their decision.

### The group works to improve how we present analysis
The Communicating Evidence group in Analytical Services works to help improve how we present evidence to customers so that they always fully understand and use the evidence we provide, and thus our evidence underpins and influences decision making throughout MoJ.
